if we have a state unique to a component only , no need to manage that im redux , we can useUse state in t hat com only


1. createStore / configurestore (use this),
  combineStore,


2. provide to app using provider and pass store 

useSelector to access the redux store functions -> for subscribing (whenever there is change , component gets rerendered)
useDispatch

Store with reducer(cntains all reducers names in combine reducer) , provied to app 
reducer -> contains the actual function (state[always previous state],action)
(prevState=initial state,action)-> as there is no prev state at first time

reducer function needs action , can be triggered using dispatcher and reducer is triggered

/redux

Redux Toolkit
slice -> directly create reducer without writing switch case n all
